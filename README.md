# Coffee-Shop-Sales -- Excel


I'm thrilled to present my latest project: Coffee Shop Sales Analysis using Microsoft Excel.

üëâ Key Findings:
‚û°Ô∏è Maximum sales occur on Fridays, with sales reaching their lowest point on weekends. This indicates that the majority of our regular customers are office-going individuals.
‚û°Ô∏è Peak sales hours are from 8 to 10 a.m., with a decline in sales after that.
‚û°Ô∏è The sales trend is positive, showing a consistent increase month over month, with June reporting the highest sales.
‚û°Ô∏è Hill's Kitchen location has generated the highest sales and orders compared to other locations.
‚û°Ô∏è The coffee shop's average price per person is $4.69, with an average order per person of 1.44.
‚û°Ô∏è The Barista Espresso coffee is the top-selling product in terms of both quantity and revenue.
‚û°Ô∏è Coffee contributes the highest percentage (39%) of revenue among all categories.
‚û°Ô∏è Regular-size coffee cups are the best-selling product.

üëâ Insights:
‚û°Ô∏è Implementing special offers or discounts in the evening could help boost sales after peak hours.
‚û°Ô∏è The focus should be placed on the main revenue-contributing categories, which are:
      - Coffee (39%)
      - Tea (28%)
      - Bakery (12%)
      - Drinking Chocolate (10%)
      - Coffee Bean (6%)
Consider eliminating categories such as packed chocolate, loose tea, and flavored beverages, as they contribute only around 1% to revenue.
